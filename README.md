### Hey there, 
I'm Bhavya, a third-year engineering student at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology with a strong interest in building meaningful tech solutions. I love blending creativity with code, whether it's designing intuitive user interfaces or implementing AI-powered backend logic. I'm currently diving deeper into full-stack development and applied machine learning.


I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, especially those that make systems smarter, experiences smoother, and lives easier. 

ðŸš€ Always learning. Always building. Always improving.
